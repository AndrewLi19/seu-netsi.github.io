  introduction: Nowadays, aerial and ground robots, wearable and portable devices are becoming smaller, lighter, cheaper, and thus popular. It is now possible to utilize tens and thousands of them to form a swarm to complete complicated cooperative tasks, such as searching, rescuing, and mapping. Low lantency ad hoc networking is critical for such applications to ensure wireless communication within such dense and dynamic swarms. This project proposes specifically designed ad hoc routing protocols for dense and dynamic swarms based on the existing optimized link state routing protocol.

  introduction: Ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless technology is becoming widely adopted in everyday life, especially after the IEEE 802.15.4z standard was published in 2020. Nowadays, the newest iPhone, and AirTags from Apple, the newest Galaxy, and SmartTag from Samsung, are all supporting UWB. In the future, not only mobile devices, but also ground and aerial robots will be equipped UWB capability. This project improves the ranging protocol and the indoor positioning for dynamic and dense swarm of devices and robots.

  introduction: Collision avoidance is one of the essential needs of dynamic and dense robotic and device swarms. Moreover, Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being widely exploited for various applications, e.g., traverse to collect data from ground sensors, patrol to monitor key facilities, move to aid mobile edge computing. We study the UAV path planning problem aiming at minimizing flight energy consumption, which is critical due to its limited onboard storage capacity. A practical speed-related energy consumption model is adopted, that is, the power consumption first decreases and then increases as speed increases.

  introduction: Millions of Internet of Thing (IoT) devices have been widely deployed to support applications such as smart city, industrial Internet, and smart transportation. These IoT devices periodically upload their collected data and reconfigure themselves to adapt to the dynamic environment. Both operations are resource consuming for low-end IoT devices. An edge computing enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is proposed to fly over to collect data and complete reconfiguration computing tasks from IoT devices.

  introduction: There are various type of sources that needs to be sought or tracked, such as wireless radio sources, thermal source, nuclear radiation source, and gas leakage source. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) fly quickly and freely in the sky, so they are suitable for source seeking and tracking, especially in a time critical scenario. However, the UAV can only sense the source strenght at its current location, how to design a moving strategy such that the source is found in the minimum steps is very challenging. This project design theoretically sound solutions for this research goal and build practically working systems.

  introduction: Energy harvesting is a promising technique to address the energy hunger problem for thousands of wireless devices. In Radio Frequency (RF) energy harvesting systems, a wireless device first harvests energy and then transmits data with this energy, hence the 'harvest-then-transmit' (HTT) principle is widely adopted. We must carefully design the HTT schedule, i.e., schedule the timing between harvesting and transmission, and decide the data transmission power such that the throughput can be maximized or the delay can be minimized.

  introduction: More and more Internet of Things (IoT) wireless devices have been providing ubiquitous services over the recent years. Since most of these devices are powered by batteries, a fundamental trade-off to be addressed is the depleted energy and the achieved data throughput in wireless data transmission. By exploiting the rate-adaptive capacities of wireless devices, we design rate-adaptive transmission policies to maximize the amount of transmitted data bits under the energy constraints of devices with deadline constraints.

  introduction: Nano unmanned aerial vehicles (NAVs) have been increasingly used for mapping due to their advantages in weight and size, such as search, rescue and reconnaissance in confined areas. However, because the resources carried by NAVs are extremely limited, it is a challenge to achieve efficient autonomous mapping in 3D space. To address this challenge, we proposes a new autonomous mapping model and system architecture with heterogeneous NAVs. Firstly, we introduces an enhanced OctoMap-based map model designed for resource-constrained NAVs. In comparison to the conventional OctoMap map model, the proposed model exhibits a significant reduction of 85.94% in memory usage while maintaining the same number of voxel blocks. In addition, We propose an active exploration algorithm based on Next Best View (NBV) theory, which dynamically balances exploration efficiency and node pruning based on memory usage, can achieve agile and efficient autonomous mapping. Furthermore, in order to break through the single NAV limitation, we further investigate the collaborative navigation of heterogeneous NAVs systems, design a communication framework for heterogeneous NAVs collaborative mapping, propose a collision prevention strategy to guarantee the collaborative safety as well as a merging ray strategy and a dynamic adjustment of edge-NAV position strategy to improve the communication quality between heterogeneous NAVs.At Last, the map model and exploration algorithms are deployed on real-world NAVs, and the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments.
